## What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is a critical step in the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design process. It represents the skeletal framework of a digital product, such as a website or application. Wireframes focus on the layout, structure, and functionality without including visual design elements like color, images, or typography.

## Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process

Wireframing serves several key purposes in software and product design:

- **Clarifies Ideas:** It helps convert conceptual ideas into a tangible structure.
- **Improves Communication:** Acts as a common visual language for developers, designers, and stakeholders.
- **Identifies Usability Issues:** Highlights navigation flow and potential user experience problems early.
- **Saves Time and Resources:** Catching issues at the wireframe stage reduces costly design or development changes later.
- **Provides Structure:** Offers a clear guide for layout and content placement in the final design.

Wireframing helps ensure that the product is functional, user-friendly, and aligned with the original design objectives before moving into high-fidelity prototyping and development.
